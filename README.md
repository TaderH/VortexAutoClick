Autoclicker for downloading Vortex Collections for any game.
You just need to run this script. Preferably, do one side of the monitor the browser and the other one Vortex.
If you do it like that - there won't be any troubles.
To stop the script you can close the script-window, or in the command line of the script hit Ctrl + C.

Good luck, stalker.
